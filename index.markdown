I'M DELETING CONTENT 
**How to Cite:**
Here, provide a citation using this model:

> Lastname, Firstname, FirstName LastName, and FirstName, Lastname. “Title of Web Page.” Name of Website (if different from web page). Publication or Revision Date. URL.

Your teams have multiple authors.  In scholarship, if authorship is equal across all team members, then the custom is to list by last name them in alphabetical order.  If you wish to deviate from this order you can but that will communicate priority (i.e. that the one who goes first is the 'lead author', etc.).

If you choose and wish to do so, you may also include a Creative Commons license here. We'll discuss those in class.

Here and throughout your edition, you should use footnotes in Chicago Notes and Bibliography style.[^1]  Please note that if sources are listed in your bibliography (and all your main ones should be), you may use a shortened form in these notes (e.g. Smith, _Towards a Better Understanding_, 5, with the full citation to Smith going in the bibliography).

# The Source

{% include media_next.html pages=media %}


This section provides the main presentation of your source, as you have prepared it for readers (i.e., a facsimile, transcription, video, audio clip, etc.). This section is where we satisfy the first of the ADE’s three criteria for an electronic edition by providing a rigorous, accurate presentation of historical material.

For the presentation of some sources, it may make sense to break up the presentation into multiple pages. For that, as needed, we can use a more book like template (binding multiple pages together) that I can provide. Nonetheless, this page should be the page from which all presentations of the source itself start.

This may also be a space where editorial annotations are provided, such as notes on provenance, archival location, transcription, and more. If possible, a link to the source’s permanent digital location should be included here as well as a citation for that location. This should be done in consultation with the instructors, editorial board, and peer reviewers.

Please note: some presentations may benefit from a multipage format (rather than one scrolling page, as here). I can make a multipage template available to you as needed.

### About this Source

In 1903, Nicholas II of Russia and his wife, Alexandra Feodorovna, hosted one of the last great social events of their empire, often overshadowed or stained by events that would transpire only a few years later with the Russian revolution. To celebrate 290 years of the Romanov family’s rule over Russia three hundred and ninety of the tsar and tsarina’s most high-profile guests gathered with them in the Winter Palace to enjoy a night of food, opera, and ballet then reconvened a few days later for a costume ball where each guest showed up in a specially made costume meant to channel the Russia of Alexi Mikhailovich, the second Romanov to hold the throne. 
This was by no means the first ball or the first ball of grandiose proportions. Inklings of _the ball_ can be traced all the way back to the pagans whose festivals often involved people donning costumes to perform ritual dances with the intention of abandoning the responsibilities and stresses of daily life.[^1] These traditions moved and evolved across many cultures and societies until they had grown into events with a potential for highly calculated social or political plays made or attended to make connections, showcase or advance status, or nurture a public persona. It mattered who you invited, who actually came, what entertainment you had, and how successful you were at juggling and accommodating the group. Throwing a really good ball could bring the host and their family many more great opportunities while throwing a rocky or bland ball could jeopardize one’s social standing.[^2] The Romanovs themselves knew how helpful a good ball could be for PR as both Elizabeth I and Catherine the Great both successfully used them to win the support of the Russian people after they had heavily doubted each woman’s fitness to rule.[^3]
        That being said, by the time the Romanovs threw this particular ball, both the crown and the people understood that it was sending a message, especially because it took place in a world that did not receive as much news as we do now. Reading about events the Romanovs attended was, in many ways, the only connection the Russian people had with their tsar. The exclusivity and luxury of the event only added to its traction as outlets all across the globe were 
publishing news and photos from this ball. The message Nicholas and Alexandra chose to broadcast across borders was one the Romanovs had chosen to put at the forefront of their rule since the assassination of Alexander II: Russia’s return to Muscovy, or an idealised version of muscovy.[^4]
The Romanovs wanted to embody a particular tsar that presented values of a true Muscovite. They wanted to mimic the reign of Alexsei Mikhailovic. “By the Treaty of Andrusovo (January 1667), which ended the Polish war, Russia won possession of Smolensk, Kiev, and the section of Ukraine lying east of the Dnieper River.”[^5] The Romanovs glorified Alexsei Mikhailovich for his conquest of Ukraine. This is also proven to be true as in the photo of Princess Kotchoubey, she is wearing an ethnic Ukrainian costume, showing how they viewed traditional Ukrainian garb as being a part of the empire.
In particular, Nicholas II tries to emulate Alexsei Mikhailovich in a couple of ways. For starters, he wore Alexsei Mikhailovich’s crown to the 1903 ball. Additionally, “Unlike the European jubilees, Nicholas’s marked major military victories, and their celebration confirmed his sense of his role of continuing his forebears’ tradition of military leadership, particularly Tsar Aleksei Mikhailovich, who extended the borders of the Empire and exemplified the spirit of Russian Orthodoxy.”[^6] It cannot be understated that what was wanted was a return to the state of the old expanded Russia. The 1903 ball was a way to present this want to go back to old Muscovite ideals. 
        But why would Nicholas II feel the need to emulate the tsars of the past? Simply put, in the late 19th century, the Romanov tsars encountered a slew of issues that were reducing their popularity. Poor management of agricultural products like grain created a famine, with an estimate of 20 million people who were impacted.[^7] While Nicholas II was not the proprietor of the famine, he still felt the effects of the plummeting popularity as a result of the famine. By incurring the images of a successful tsar of the past, Nicholas was attempting to mitigate the damage created by the famine. In addition to the famine, lack of action towards violent outbursts in the country, such as pogroms, also contributed to the Romanov’s poor reputation with the Russian people. In 1881, after the assassination of Alexander II, multiple pogroms swept across the nation, including a major one that saw the destruction of over 418 Jewish homes and 290 Jewish shops.[^8] The army watched from the sidelines and did not step in to help as they were not ordered to help by the tsar. His inaction is likely due to the “Russiafication” portion of his muscovite agenda. Not only did he want the country to become more autocratic but more “ethnically Russian” as well, something jewish citizens were perceived as hindrances to.[^9] Many of the guests of the 1903 ball were dressed in military uniforms and regalia, glorifying the army instead of criticizing it. 
Peter the Great brought Russia into the Western sphere, but as the West came to put more value in democracy and civil liberties the more disconnected the Russian crown felt. A return to muscovy meant the continued absolutism of the Russian monarchy.[^10] The crown threw this ball, often estimated to have cost between 7 and 10 million dollars, with tax payer money at a time when actions were being made to disband local government. Many Russians were struggling with poverty, and the country was still recovering from a major famine, and jews were being killed without government intervention.[^11] Comparable parties of the era include the 1883 Vanderbilt masquerade ball and the 1893 Bradly Martin ball costing 6 and 10 million respectively which might make the scale of the winter ball seem slightly justifiable until you realize the Romanovs only had about a third of the guests both those exceedingly lavish parties did.[^12] Investing so much money and energy into an event like this told the world exactly what the Romanovs valued and who they did not. 
	All the guests attending the ball were possibly required to have photos of them in their costumes before the ball began. The photos were taken at various photography studios and some by various private photographers. Some of the names of these photography studios and private photographers that are presented in the photos are Boissonas & Eggler, Levitsky, and Les Theatres Imperiaux. The images themselves were printed and sold to attendees of the ball and the profits went to charity. The full prints were described as being, “a limited edition album containing the photographs were released, consisting of ten large-format files (folders). 21 heliogravures and 174 phototypes.”[^13] At this time, which charity the money went towards is unknown. The University of Illinois came to be in possession of approximately 40 of the individual photographs when historian Ralph T. Fisher Jr. established the Russian and Eastern European Center in 1958.[^14] The photos remained un-catalogged in the University's system for 60 years until they came into the hands of associate professor Christopher “Kit” Condill who works in the International and Area Studies Library at the University.[^15] Historians today can use the photographs to have a better grasp of the rise of Muscovitism during the final years of the Russian Empire. It also helps the viewers to have an understanding of Romanov parties and balls and how they connect to politics of the time.
