# Introduction  
  
Tsar Nicholas II of the Russian Empire hosted a grand ball in February of 1903. The dress code was unique, as all the guests were required to dress up in costumes imitating the 17th century. Featured costumes included general nobility, military uniforms, ethnic outfits, and more. The guest list included nobles from Russia as well as allied countries. Guests dressed up in extravagant gowns and uniforms meant to reflect the era of one of the first Romanovs to hold the throne, Alexsei Mikhailovich. The purpose of the ball was to celebrate 290 years of the Romanov dynasty.[^1]

Each guest would have photos of their costumes taken by private photographers and studios before the festivities began. Those photos were then printed into an album and sold to the guests as a memento with the proceeds going to charity.[^2] The University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign has approximately 40 of the individual photos from one of the albums in their collection after Ralph T. Fisher brought them to the university in the 1950s.[^3] We have currently selected 5 photos to digitally scan and translate their text. These 5 images reflect not only the glitz and glamour of the ball, but the political messages behind them as well and how they connect to a bigger picture of the failures of the later Romanovs.

# About this Source

In 1903, Nicholas II of Russia and his wife, Alexandra Feodorovna, hosted one of the last great social events of their empire, often overshadowed or stained by events that would transpire only a few years later with the Russian revolution. To celebrate 290 years of the Romanov family’s rule over Russia three hundred and ninety of the tsar and tsarina’s most high-profile guests, including the crowned prince of Siam, gathered with them in the Winter Palace to enjoy festivities taking place over the course of two days: February 7 and February 11. [^4] The first night took place in the Hermitage Theatre where guests watched dancers perform a traditional Russian dance afterwhich guests danced the waltz. When the party reconvened four days later, guests donned costumes channeling those living under the Russian empire in the 17th century. They were then paired up to greet the tsar and tsarina with "a Russian Bow." They also enjoyed Feodor Chaliapan and Nina Figner's performances of scenes from the opera _Boris Godunov_ and the ballets _Swan Lake_ and _La Bayadére_ featuring famous ballerina Anna Pavlova. All of this to channel and celebrarte what they felt was best about their country, primarily the world of Alexi Mikhailovich, the second Romanov to hold the throne. [^5]

This was by no means the first ball or the first ball of grandiose proportions. Inklings of _the ball_ can be traced all the way back to the pagans whose festivals often involved people donning costumes to perform ritual dances with the intention of abandoning the responsibilities and stresses of daily life.[^6] These traditions moved and evolved across many cultures and societies until they had grown into events with a potential for highly calculated social or political plays made or attended to make connections, showcase or advance status, or nurture a public persona. It mattered who you invited, who actually came, what entertainment you had, and how successful you were at juggling and accommodating the group. Throwing a really good ball could bring the host and their family many more great opportunities while throwing a rocky or bland ball could jeopardize one’s social standing.[^7] The Romanovs themselves knew how helpful a good ball could be for PR as both Elizabeth I and Catherine the Great both successfully used them to win the support of the Russian people after they had heavily doubted each woman’s fitness to rule.[^8]

That being said, by the time the Romanovs threw this particular ball, both the crown and the people understood that it was sending a message. The exclusivity and luxury of the event only added to its traction as outlets all across the globe were 
publishing news and photos from this ball. Many scholars, including Richard Wortman, have written extensively on the efforts of the Russian crown to return to Muscovy, or an idealised version of muscovy, particularly after the assasination of Alexander II.[^9] In his memoirs, which are often regarded as holding details important to the historical understanding of the tsar and tsarina due to his position in their inner circle, Alexsandr Mososlov, the head of chancellery at the Ministry of the Court, gives critical insight as to what specifically Nicholas II saw this ball as. According to him, Nicholas II intended the 1903 winter ball to be the first step to recenter muscovite style and tradition in the Russian court. He had planned to organize many more events and appearances similar to this one with the court and himself championing 17th century garb, ceremony, and belief but ultimately abandoned these plans after due to the sheer cost of this event.[^10] 

The Romanovs wanted to embody a particular tsar that presented values of a true Muscovite. They wanted to mimic the reign of Alexsei Mikhailovic. “By the Treaty of Andrusovo (January 1667), which ended the Polish war, Russia won possession of Smolensk, Kiev, and the section of Ukraine lying east of the Dnieper River.”[^11] The Romanovs glorified Alexsei Mikhailovich for his conquest of Ukraine. This is also proven to be true as in the photo of Princess Kotchoubey, she is wearing an ethnic Ukrainian costume, showing how they viewed traditional Ukrainian garb as being a part of the empire.
In particular, Nicholas II tries to emulate Alexsei Mikhailovich in a couple of ways. For starters, he wore Alexsei Mikhailovich’s crown to the 1903 ball. Additionally, “Unlike the European jubilees, Nicholas’s marked major military victories, and their celebration confirmed his sense of his role of continuing his forebears’ tradition of military leadership, particularly Tsar Aleksei Mikhailovich, who extended the borders of the Empire and exemplified the spirit of Russian Orthodoxy.”[^12] It cannot be overstated that what was wanted was a return to the state of the old expanded Russia. The 1903 ball was a way to present this want to go back to old Muscovite ideals. 

But why would Nicholas II feel the need to emulate the tsars of the past? Simply put, in the late 19th century, the Romanov tsars encountered a slew of issues that were reducing their popularity. Poor management of agricultural products like grain created a famine, with an estimate of 20 million people who were impacted.[^13] While Nicholas II was not the proprietor of the famine, he still felt the effects of the plummeting popularity as a result of the famine. By incurring the images of a successful tsar of the past, Nicholas was attempting to mitigate the damage created by the famine. In addition to the famine, lack of action towards violent outbursts in the country, such as pogroms, also contributed to the Romanov’s poor reputation with the Russian people. In 1881, after the assassination of Alexander II, multiple pogroms swept across the nation, including a major one that saw the destruction of over 418 Jewish homes and 290 Jewish shops.[^14] The army watched from the sidelines and did not step in to help as they were not ordered to help by the tsar. His inaction is likely due to the “Russiafication” portion of his muscovite agenda. Not only did he want the country to become more autocratic but more “ethnically Russian” as well, something jewish citizens were perceived as hindrances to.[^15] Many of the guests of the 1903 ball were dressed in military uniforms and regalia, glorifying the army instead of criticizing it. 

Peter the Great brought Russia into the Western sphere, but as the West came to put more value in democracy and civil liberties the more disconnected the Russian crown felt. A return to muscovy meant the continued absolutism of the Russian monarchy.[^16] The crown threw this ball, often estimated to have cost between 7 and 10 million dollars, with tax payer money at a time when actions were being made to disband local government. Many Russians were struggling with poverty, and the country was still recovering from a major famine, and jews were being killed without government intervention.[^17] Comparable parties of the era include the 1883 Vanderbilt masquerade ball and the 1893 Bradly Martin ball costing 6 and 10 million respectively which might make the scale of the winter ball seem slightly justifiable until you realize the Romanovs only had about a third of the guests both those exceedingly lavish parties did.[^18] Investing so much money and energy into an event like this told the world exactly what the Romanovs valued and who they did not. 

All the guests attending the ball required to have photos of them in their costumes before the ball began. The photos were taken at various photography studios and some by various private photographers. Some of the names of these photography studios and private photographers that are presented in the photos are Boissonas & Eggler, Levitsky, and Les Theatres Imperiaux. The images themselves were printed in an album titled "Album of the Costume Ball and Winter Palace" and sold to attendees of the ball and the profits went to charity.[^19] The full prints were described as being, “a limited edition album containing the photographs were released, consisting of ten large-format files (folders). 21 heliogravures and 174 phototypes.”[^20] Profits from the album went toward supporting Russian troops stationed in the East.[^21] The University of Illinois came to be in possession of approximately 40 of the individual photographs when historian Ralph T. Fisher Jr. established the Russian and Eastern European Center in 1958.[^22] The photos remained un-catalogged in the University's system for 60 years until they came into the hands of associate professor Christopher “Kit” Condill who works in the International and Area Studies Library at the University.[^23] Historians today can use the photographs to have a better grasp of the rise of Muscovitism during the final years of the Russian Empire. It also helps the viewers to have an understanding of Romanov parties and balls and how they connect to politics of the time.

# About this Edition

For this edition we are presenting photos of aristocrats in their costumes taken for the 1903 Romanov ball celebrating 300 years of reigning in power. The photos have come from a book with the photos pressed into large sheets of paper and it is a possibility that this book might have been auctioned out for charity at some point. These photos may be found today at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign in the International and Area Studies library upon request. Originally, the photos ended up in the hands of Ralph T. Fisher, the founder of the Russian, East European, and Eurasian center back in 1958 at the University of Illinois at Urbana Champaign. It is possible that Fisher brought the photos over from Yale University, but this is not known for certain. They eventually went into the Slavic backlog and were never cataloged. How the photos ended up with Ralph T. Fisher is still unknown. We have used colored scans of the photos using a KIC scanner to present them on this site. We have chosen images for variety and for use in prototyping. Additionally, there were no alterations made to the photos themselves.
