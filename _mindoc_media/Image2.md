_title: Baron Vladmir Bonsovich Frederiks Dressed as Hetman Bogdan Khmelnitsky
description: The Baron stands a against a lighter background which emphasizes the dark colors of his costume which channels the portrait of a Boyer military general. A thin, curtain is draped at the right corner of the photo and he stands on two ornate rugs that overlap at their corners. He wears a black fitted coat heavily patteren with a light floral pattern that seems to have a metallic, shiny quality. The sleeves extend down his arms and are fitted to his wrists, the is very high, almost resembling a turtle-neck, and the garment falls just below his knees. About his waist he has tied a thick strip of with fabric and at his side rests what seems to be a highly decorated sheath for a sword. Over top of this he wears a dark coat trimmed with dark fur at the cuffs and collar. He wears it more as a cape than a coat as his arms are not through the sleeves electin to instead fasten the collar around his neck with a very large and shiny broach. If one looks closely they can spot the golden brocade and buttons that decorate the front of this coat. Atop his head sits a boxy fur hat with two large white feather springing out of a bejewelled decoration at the top center. These two feathers perfectly match the very impressive, very bushy mustache that adorns his face.
