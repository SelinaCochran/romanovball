description: The Photo is centered in a yellowing page which one can see around the border. The background is very archictectural with reliefs of arches and pillars raised off the wall. It is the only group photo from the party in the university's collection. It features 14 men including Prince Chakrabon. They are all wearing Lancers uniforms identical to the one described previously described. Six sit in the front row with eight standing in the second. Two tables are sprinkled in with the first row holding very fine dishware whose significsnce is unknown. Many of the men are also holding cups, two in the front are holding larger dishes of various shapes.
