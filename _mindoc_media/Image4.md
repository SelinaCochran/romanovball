_title: Prince Chakrabon Dressed as a Commander of the Lancers 
description: The Photo is centered in a yellowing page which one can see around the border. It features Prince Chakrabon of Siam dressed as a commander of the Lancers. The Prince stands against a solid grey background with one had on his hip looking into the distance off camera. He wear a knee length military coat which seems to be made of a darker velvety material. At his waist is tied a scarf similar to that of Baron Bonsovich except this one is black and has ends that flow out from between its own wraps and end in large, thick, tassels. About his waist is also fastened a ceremonial sword which hangs at his left side just below the hand on his hip. His hand placement shows off the very dratic cuff of his fit which might be made of leather due to its stiffness, shine, and bracer-like quality. He also wears dark leather gloces. Across his chest light brocade makes the four fasteners holding the coat closed more decorative, with a tassel ending the line stemming from each button and fastener. The coat has a very high collar as does the shirt he wears underneath which covers his entire neck and is patterned with wavy embroidery. He wears a boxy hat of dark far with a more decorative bit coming out of the top. Adorning his feet are knee-high leather boots which curl upward at the toes.
