_title: Princess Elena Konstantinova Kochubuei Dressed as a noblewoman of 17th Century Ukraine 
description: The Photo is centered in a yellowing page which one see around the border. It features Princess Elena Konstantinova Kochubuei costumed as a Ukranian noblewoman of 17th century Ukraine. An heavily patterened curtain flows all the way to the ground on the left side of photograph. What seems to be a wooden coffee table is placed against the wall behind he and she is standing on very ornate carpet. Her dress definitley sets itself apart from the gowns of those dressed like boyar women. Whereas others are very blocky hers is much more fitted, accentuating a very angular waist. Her base layers for the outfit seem to be a white blouse tucked into a light skirt emproidered with a design of vines and leaves. Overtop of her blouse she wears a front lacing bodice of a stays sort of style. At her neck a dark bow is fastened at the center of her collar and she wears many beaded necklaces. This and the ring she wears on her left hand are the only precious materials in the costume where as the boyar costumes were dripping with shinies. However, she is wearing what seems to be a very tall and triangular kokoshnik on her head. To complete her look, she dons an overcoat with a darker floral pattern which contrasts nicely with the lighter colors of the blouse and skirt. A thick trim of dark fur runs alon the edges of the coat, creating very pronounced cuffs and a wide lapel.
