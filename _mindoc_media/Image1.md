_title: Sofia Petrovna Durnoro Dressed as Boyar Woman
description: Durnoro stands against a dark curtained background that makes her lighter outfit stand out. She dons a floor length gown that channels those of 17th century Russia. The shape is very stiff and does not have much body to it but is heavily decorated with embroidery and precious gems. Her arms are placed at her sides to show off her wide sleeves that flown downward into a point at what would be about her knee. Dark fur trims a second overcoatesque layer of the gown creating nice lines the empasize the shape of the geometric gown. Pearls and precious gems hanging from the kokoshnik (a very tall, traditional hat worn by Russian women of the time) atop her head surround her face. She completes her outfit with a sheet white scarf with a fine, white tassel trim around the edge thrown loosely around her head (including the kokoshnik) and shoulders.
